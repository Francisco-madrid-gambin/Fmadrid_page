### PRBB - Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, Barcelona 

PRBB is a large scientific infrastructure, located next to the Hospital del Mar in Barcelona (Spain), which brings together six closely coordinated public research centres. Each centre is independent and the PRBB Consortium is responsible for managing the building and services, as well as coordinating the scientific activity common to all centres.

### IMIM - Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute 

The Hospital del Mar Institute for Medical Research (IMIM), a Spanish public organisation created in 1947 and dedicated to scientific research in the field of biomedicine and health sciences, is located in the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park. In December 2013 it became one of the health research institutes officially accredited by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III.

**Achievements**

Francisco was involved in several projects as lead biostatistician. In a European project Francisco performed metabolomic and integrated network analysis, published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy (IF 2022: 7.5, ranking Pharmacology and Pharmacy 23/277, 10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112845). In this international project, he also led a systematic review on metabolomics analysis in the same journal (DOI: 10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115775).

**Figure.**  Heatmap analysis performed by using regularized canonical correlations analysis showing the relation between ayahuasca alkaloids and ayahuasca-subjective effects against metabolomic dataset, after the intake of ayahuasca.

As computational scientist, Francisco co-first authored investigation in data integration by means of a N-integration with Projection to Latent Structures model to study the relationship of metabolism and sperm quality, function and fertility, Communications Biology (IF 2022: 5.9, ranking Biology 12/92. DOI: 10.1038/s42003-023-04715-3). This project aimed to predict the rate of insemination success and *in vitro* fertilising ability.

**Figure.**  Reduced-dimension feature vectors from projection are shown in the left, and permutation tests based on the prediction capability are depicted on the right. In the x-axis, PLS regression plots show original centred, reduced-dimension feature vectors from each principal component analysis. The values predicted by the models are displayed on the y axis. The slope is defined by the prediction capability values (Q2) tested through permutation tests. The vertical lines of permutation test plots indicate the Q2 values obtained in each block.

### Royal College of Surgeon in Ireland 

The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) is a medical professional and educational institution, which is also known as RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ireland's first private university. It was established in 1784 as the national body for the surgical branch of medicine in Ireland, with a role in supervision of training, and as of 2021 provides a broad range of medical education in multiple countries.
