Hello world.

I hold a Ph.D. in Health Science from the University of Barcelona (2017, Spain), where I specialized in biomarker discovery using untargeted metabolomics techniques. My doctoral work involved leading data mining projects, developing lab SOPs, and managing human intervention studies. During my postdoctoral stay at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, I investigated the risk of psychosis using omics integration in R Studio, contributing to several high-impact publications. Additionally, I conducted research in the field of nutritional biomarkers at UCD.

Upon returning to Spain, I worked as a consultant for over two years at the [Institute for BioEngineering of Catalonia](https://ibecbarcelona.eu/) where I collaborated with [Nestlé Institute Health Science](https://www.nestlehealthscience.com/) to develop machine learning and signal processing solutions for metabolomics and proteomics studies. This work resulted in the development of an R software tool, now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sipss) and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AlpsNMR.html)). I was also responsible for developing the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for the Nestlé clinical trial [NCT02646969](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02646969), registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.

After finishing my postdoctoral program **Juan de la Cierva** on biomedicine, I am working as a biostatistician at the [Hospital del Mar Research Institute](https://www.imim.es/en_index.html), where I lead a structural data analysis platform and co-direct a doctoral thesis on early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (improving accuracy up to 80 %, patent under evaluation). My role involves providing critical support to medical research projects in fields such as neurosciences, cancer, and epidemiology through Real-World Evidence. This position has enabled me to make direct contributions to translational medicine and the advancement of biomedicine. My work has been recognized with several awards, including **1st prize** for poster presentation in the European-Metabomeeting (2020),  **1st prize** for oral communication in the XXV Conference Asociación Española de Coloproctología (2022) and **“Best abstract”** in the XVIII Conference European Society of Coloproctology (2023). I also serve as an assistant professor of statistical learning and biostatistics at UPF, UB, and IL3.
